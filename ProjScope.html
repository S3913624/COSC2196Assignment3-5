<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
<p>Given the timeframe and overall progress throughout the project, we are limited in what can be delivered. We will set out to achieve our overarching goal, that is, end up with an application deployable on an android device that would convert a numerical value into another numeric value, in order to convert resistance to temperature. <br><br>

We limited the scope by considering deployment on android devices only. It would be nice to deploy on iPhones as well, but this avenue is seriously restrictive and not feasible given our time limits. additionally, none in the team own any apple products to test on.<br><br>

Further, we would like to implement the other calculations, such as the temperature unit selection, or the tolerance calculator as outlined, but if we don’t have time, that’s ok. We still have an application that meets our original design criteria. However, we absolutely did not consider incorporating into the scope any different temperature sensors. This is just a whole different kettle of fish, operating under a completely different principle to our IEC60751 sensors, and we simply did not have time.<br><br>

Because of this, we also eliminated consultation with manufacturers or metrology labs from the scope. We felt the project would not be complete enough, and would not be presentable to professionals who understand the concepts discussed.<br><br>

That being said, should we have an extra 10 weeks, it is not unreasonable to consider including these aspects in the scope.</p>
