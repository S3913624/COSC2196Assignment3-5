<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
<h4>Daniel Wilkinson</h4>
<p>Several aspects that worked well within team 404 are very reminiscent of assignment 2. One of the biggest things that worked well was continuing with the scheduled meetings. There were few occasions in which all members were unable to attend. Ensuring we were each engaging with the team schedule enabled us to maintain our efforts in collating the assignment and coordinate these efforts professionally and efficiently.<br><br>

Surprisingly, there were few issues. We stayed on top of things, but there was one identifiable issue made obvious throughout the weeks. Thankfully we amended swiftly, which involved rescheduling one of the meetings. As previously mentioned, it was originally a strength to have a team meeting after our course wide lecture, but at the same time, we found that if the lecture ran overtime, it was a serious struggle the group was unable to commit to. We did manage to correct this after a particularly long lecture and found we still operated very well.<br><br>

In assignment 2 an item I remarked on as being a source of improvement was the addition of milestones and date targets for components of the assignment. As a group we strove to set these timeframes much more than the previous assignment and saw this worked exceptionally well. Working in teams again in the future, I’d be very inclined to continue this trend.   </p>
<h4>Mathew Phillips</h4>
<p>Team 404 performed predictably well in assignment 3, having come in with an already solid foundation from the learning experience that was Assignment 2. The decision to have people specialise more during this assignment than the last has, I think, improved the quality of our work overall. Also, the decision to move the post-lecture meeting to the day before was an excellent one, giving us a similar gap between each meeting to work on things and meaning that if the lecture ran overtime (which they always seem to do) we were not sacrificing sleep to update each other on how things were going.<br><br>

Still the team occasionally struggled to have deliverables ready at promised time, in part due to lockdowns and the like, but still this could be improved in future work.<br><br>

I was surprised at how easily the formula for the App was converted to JavaScript, Nick made me believe it would be a struggle, but it turned out to only be half an hour's work.<br><br>

I learned that groups are an excellent way to divide workload into more specialised parts for specialised people to improve the overall quality of the final product. </p>

<p>Keeping with the group structure was integral to the development of group 404. For this assignment we changed things up compared to assignment two, in that we stuck to our roles, in turn, sticking to our strengths. It enabled us to synergise more effectively, unlike in assignment two where each of us dabbled across different roles, contributing to each part of the final result. <br><br>

Another component that worked well in our favour was getting stuck into it early on. After the completion of assessment 2 we took weeks break before coming back in guns blazing and smashing through a lot of the early stages of the assignment. <br><br>

Personally speaking, one thing that could have been improved upon was my focus. Towards the crucial very end of the project, extenuating circumstances did not permit me to dedicate my time as I had fully intended. Regrettably there was very little I could do about it, but thankfully the team was there for me 100% and we were not delayed at all. <br><br>
A surprising element from this assessment would definitely be the role association which worked extremely well with our group. As mentioned, this allowed us to accomplish an exceedingly large-scale assignment to (in our opinion) a high degree, in a small frame of time.   </p>

<h4>Nick Parker</h4>
<p>Surprisingly, the team banded together behind my idea, and took on a real challenge that was way outside their comfort zone. In assignment two I commended my colleagues for endeavouring to undertake a project like this. Now that it’s over, I cannot stress enough how impressed I am with everyone’s efforts. To say I am merely surprised at the work ethic of a group of first year university students does not do them justice.<br><br>

In assignment 2 there was occasionally a breakdown in communication. We clearly learned our lessons about being open, and were able to continue our honest dialogue to great benefit. Regrettably, we did lapse on occasions when it came to individual targets. This we can improve on, as almost all of us were guilty of committing to the delivery of a section, and being delayed. Thankfully we were on top of things from the outset, and where one failed, others could help take up the slack. After all, that’s what being in a team is all about.<br><br>

In assignment 2 I learned how to break a complex project into clearly defined steps or sections. For this assignment I was pleased to be able to build on this, and it was of great help. Additionally, taking more of a leadership role this time around, I learned how to communicate and manage a team whilst remaining respectful and collegial. It is these skills that will prove extremely valuable going forward. </p>
<h4>Group</h4>
<p>It is generally agreed upon by the majority of the group that the communication we committed ourselves to was of great benefit. To begin with we were all apprehensive about completing a group assignment with strangers from all corners of the country, as our individual differences and opinions could pave the way for potential disputes over how to attack the assessment. However, our open and honest communication helped avert such conflicts and we feel it was the foundation of our efforts.<br> <br>

A primary effect felt from the last assignment stemmed from our collaborative efforts on the website using GitHub. A number of the team felt we left it a bit late, and as such there a was a bit of a ‘last minute dash’ to complete the assignment to a high level. We remarked in assignment 2 that it was an area that could have been improved on by beginning work on the website earlier. This in turn also would have helped prevent clashes of numerous people working on the website at the same time. This problem was further exasperated by the fact that GitHub may take upwards of 10 minutes to commit any changes done by individuals. This problem was pre-emptively considered at the outset of assignment 3 to mitigate these issues entirely. We were very pleased with the results.<br><br>

A surprising aspect that was universally felt was the way in which the team handled their individual tasks. Each of us put their hands up swiftly for work and were eager to help in contributing to the assessment as a whole. The breakdown of key components within the assessment, turning them into steps and sections allowed for easy allocation of time and resources to achieve our goals. It was well felt throughout the group, when each of our sections had realised and noticeable accomplishments.<br><br>

Overall, we learnt how to work collaboratively and efficiently. It is our belief that this is the crux of the series of group assignments thought the course. Yes, we learned some topical components, but it is the two key components outlined in the outcomes we are most pleased to have learned.<br><br>



CLO4: Identify principles of collaborative work and explain potential conflict resolution techniques <br><br>

CLO5: Participate effectively and creatively in a team environment <br><br>



It is these two outcomes we can take away with us as individuals, and apply to whatever field we choose to go in to. It is these two outcomes that bridge all industries, not just IT. We are extremely grateful to have learned them. </p>
