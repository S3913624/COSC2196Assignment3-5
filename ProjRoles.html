  <h4>Roles</h4>
  <p>For the purposes of staying organised, the group felt it important to allocate strict roles and endeavour to stick to those roles. The group felt it would help keep each of us accountable, and stay on task to meet deadlines. Additionally, the group felt this approach the most practical as it imitated a real-world, professionally orientated approach, and thus, we could appreciate the core goals of the assignment in much greater depth. <br><br>

  It is to be said however, we will all need to extend our reach beyond our strict roles. That will involve writing different sections of the report and participate in building the website. We will each be able to have input on everyone’s interpretation of any particular aspect of the project, and everyone’s opinion should be considered equally valid.</p>

  <h5>Nick – Project Manager</h5>
  <p>Nick has years of experience already as a project manager, delivering on high dollar projects and managing internal teams, suppliers, and clients. More than that, the project idea was Nicks, and it is therefore completely justified he take lead, given the niche application knowledge required. Nick has the knowledge and skills to support the team, and has the dedication and altruism to take the project all the way, as proved in his Myers-Briggs personality profile results. <br> <br>

  Besides technical knowledge surrounding the overall goal, it will be Nicks responsibility to allocate tasks to the other team members based on their roles, assist and support them with any difficulties, review and write documentation for the project. The main role will to just be aware of the requirements of each and every stage, and ensure they are being met in a timely and efficient manner to the best of everyone’s abilities.</p>

  <h5>Perrin – Programmer</h5>
  <p>Perrin has the most programming experience and knowledge of various frameworks to get the project up and running. Perrin is self-taught but has completed a certificate III in computer science. In this way, and based on input through team meetings, the group felt Perrin to be the most suitable candidate to lead the team in programming the app. Additionally, Perrin was a high-level mathematics student in high school, so is well versed in understanding the equations used throughout the project. It will be Perrins’s responsibility to oversee documentation and planning of the specific requirements of the project, with guidance from the project manager.</p>

  <h5>Mat – Programmer / Web Developer</h5>
  <p>The group felt it important to have more than one programmer to assist, and provide fresh eyes and ideas in the event the project stalled. Because of Mats high school studies, two years of IT, the group felt it appropriate to use Mats skills to support Perrin. Mat and Perrin would work together in documenting the technical aspects of the project and coming up with a structured plan. They will bounce ideas off each other, try out different programming tactics to each other and provide constructive commentary on each other’s work. <br> <br>

  Mat also proved an asset throughout Assignment 2 with his web development skills. As mentioned previously, the group soon discovered that all of us working on the website at once, doing different things in different ways was not productive. It is therefore justified that Mat take the lead in developing the assignment 3 website for the team. Mat will control the theme and layout, and alongside the project manager, will review the final version of the website.</p>

  <h5>Daniel – Quality Assurance and Testing</h5>
  <p>Daniel has proven an asset to the team with his report writing skills throughout the course, and has provided valuable input through team meetings, being able to question the groups direction or highlight alternative methods in a productive and polite manner. Daniel has been able to collate documentation from the previous assignment in a professional and consistent manner, and it is these aspects that make Daniel most suitable to handle the quality assurance role. <br><br>

  Daniel has proven a keen eye for detail and will work with the programmers and the project lead in presenting consistent, professional documentation. Most importantly, Daniel will be responsible for making sure the application works as intended. Daniel will handle the final product, try to break it, and try to work out ways to make the product more intuitive.</p>

  <h5>Shawn – Digital Assets and Marketing</h5>
  <p>Shawn has shown an aptitude for graphic design, in particular, the 6.2.2 task – “Day to day usage of mobile technology”. Shawn’s efforts went above and beyond, and proved a keen interest in video production. Shawn volunteered to take lead as creative director for the presentation and the group could think of no other suitable candidate. <br><br>

  In addition to taking lead of the presentation, Shawn will be responsible for all other aspects of the graphical requirements of the project. Creating buttons, themes and layouts the programmers can use. Assisting Mat with the website, and assisting Daniel with consistent visual formatting of the reports will also be important.</p>
