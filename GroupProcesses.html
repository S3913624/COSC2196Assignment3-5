<h3>Group Processes </h3>

<p>Each of us were exceptionally pleased with the result of Assignment 2. We graded high, there were no conflicts, and there was no substantial cramming of content in at the last minute. We were all satisfied with the level of participation and behaviour, and we endeavour to perform even better for Assignment 3. </p>

<p>In this way, we do not expect to change the group processes going forward. We will aim to hold meetings twice a week again, to discuss progress, provide each other with feedback on different areas, and consider tasks allocation. This is a good opportunity to bring up any problems or mention any events that could have potential to delay the project, and is regular enough that we have ample work to do in between, but still keep in close contact and sociable. </p>

<p>As in Assignment 2, the group felt it was beneficial to leave the website to last, and focus on the content of the report. We all agreed it was better to use the report as the basis, and try to mirror into a website once most of the content was written and presentable. However, we feel we did perhaps leave this a little late, and we agree that everyone contributing at the same time was not productive. We found it difficult to keep up with the commits and the delay between a commit and it being viewable online was irritating. Because of this, we will have one team member, the most skilled in html and CSS control the majority of the website, and we will be starting earlier. The website will be paginated early, and the CSS style sheet will be clean and tidy even before we begin to upload content. </p>

<p>Based on our input and areas we individually excelled in from Assignment 2, we would endeavour to allocate tasks more appropriately. Some were better at report writing. Others were better with graphics or keeping consistent with the overall visual theme of the report. It is to be said however that we would each have the same input and value on any given task, and appropriate constructive commentary is welcomed by all. </p>

<p>Finally, it has been discussed that the group would ideally embrace a kaizen business philosophy, that is, a philosophy of constant, seemingly insignificant improvement in all areas. It stands to reason that there may seem like no improvement or substantial change in the moment, but gradually, and in hindsight, improvement will be clear and the benefits obvious. We are excited to get started.  </p>
