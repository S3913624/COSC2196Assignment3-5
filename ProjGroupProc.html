<h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3>
<p>We aimed to hold meetings through MS teams twice a week, to discuss progress, provide each other with feedback on different areas, and consider task allocation. We found it a good opportunity to bring up any problems or mention any events that could have potential to delay the project, and was regular enough that we had ample work to do in between, but still keep in close contact and sociable. <br><br>

In order to keep in touch with each other, or ask questions outside of these meetings, or to provide each other with updates on where weâ€™re at with any particular tasks, we posted regularly in the chat section of MS Teams. It was instant enough that we could action anything we needed to urgently and efficiently. Further, we posted updates on the announcement board of MS Teams when tasks had been completed, so our colleagues could perhaps commence work on their section. <br><br>

As for our processes, we allocated tasks appropriately based on our defined roles and skills. Some were better at report writing. Others were obviously more programming inclined, while others were better with graphics or keeping consistent with the overall visual theme of the project. We encouraged constructive commentary in all areas, and we each asked for opinions and could discuss any aspect of the project with each other. <br><br>

Most of all, we held each other accountable. We had time frames and milestones. We tried our hardest not to let the team down. By keeping with the group processes and team dynamic, and by being open and honest with each other, we were able to pull off, in our opinion, a comprehensive and professional attempt at completing our project as intended.</p>
