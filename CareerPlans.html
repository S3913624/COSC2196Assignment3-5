  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>The first noticeable characteristic of the groups career paths is that, although some roles appear similar at face value, there are a notable lack of similarities about the specifics of the roles. Each individual has chosen a different avenue and the different skills required reflect this. As an example, although the group have two parties broadly interested in cyber security, one is driven more towards the technical security side and the other has opted for the business side which only requires an awareness of security and IT. Another example is the developer programmer vs. gameplay programmer. Fundamentally the roles are similar, but the requirements and skills required differ vastly.</p>

  <p>As was expected however, experience is mandatory and is outlined as a requirement in every single advertisement. Interestingly though, a degree does not appear to be as important as experience as it is only mentioned in three out of five advertisements.</p>

  <p>The groups career plans are dissimilar enough that it is clearly highlighted how broad IT is as a whole. There are a range of different skills and abilities sought after by potential employers and it would be naïve to think that one could become a master of all trades and get a job in any IT industry without serious commitment to different skill development and obtaining relevant experiences.</p>
